<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
The Problem</A>
</H1>

<P>
I am an avid reader. In fact, most of the space in my shelves is used by
books. Books that cover many different topics: Maths, Physics,
Programming, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Dramas/Plays, Poems, Classics...

<P>
Recently, I became aware of the fact that this collection had to be
sorted and catalogued, somehow. This would enable me to sort out the
duplicate books<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot7"><SUP>1</SUP></A> and to prevent getting duplicates.
Moreover, I said to myself:

<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If I catalogue <I>all</I> books that are stored somewhere
in our house, I could easily spot the literary gems that are present in
some dark box, unbeknownst to me and the others.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<P>
To solve this problem, several subproblems had to be taken care of:
<B>What</B> book data do I need? <B>How</B> do I get this data?
<B>Where</B> do I store the data?  Thus, the problem was well-defined
and I could begin looking for solutions.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
A Solution</A>
</H1>

<P>
In Germany, most of the books that are published are assigned a unique
number, the ISBN<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="#foot15"><SUP>2</SUP></A>. On newer
books, this number is printed on the back of the book as a barcode,
allowing booksellers to get information (price etc.) about the book as
quickly as possible.

<P>
For many years, the ISBN was a 10-digit number: 9 digits for the code
itself and one for the checksum. However, since the beginning of 2007
(European) books are required to carry a 13-digit ISBN on their backs:
The EAN<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="#foot16"><SUP>3</SUP></A>. EAN is a much more
general code that is, as the name implies, used for other product
categories, such as DVDs, CDs or food.

<P>
Luckily (for me), the 13-digit ISBNs are a subset of the 13-digit
EANs<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="#foot17"><SUP>4</SUP></A>, so there would be no
conversion necessary between these two codes.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">
Getting data</A>
</H2>

<P>
Quite naturally, the thought of how to exploit this fact came almost
immediately to me. Given a list of EANs<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="#foot19"><SUP>5</SUP></A>, I could
get all the data I need if I had a source that allowed me to search for
EANs and return information about the item.

<P>
Since I have not much money to spend on this project, I decided to query
the most comprehensive (and free!) database of books I knew:
The online bookstore ``amazon.com''.

<P>
This task was easier than I expected it to be: amazon.com provides
developers with (free) access to the ``Amazon E-Commerce Service''
(ECS). Being an amazon.com customer anyway, after reading the
documentation, I decided to sign up for it and give it a try.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Getting EANs</A>
</H2>

<P>
Before doing anything else, I first had to find a way of how to read
EANs. I was not willing to enter <I>all</I> EANs manually. But what was
good for booksellers should work for me as well. So I bought an
<TT>OVOX CCD-800 USB Barcode Scanner</TT>.

<P>
This device is truly perfectly suited for my needs: It reads EAN and UPC
barcodes in all flavours (and a whole lot more barcodes which I will
probably never encounter in my life) fast and reliably (if the barcode
can be read, it will be read properly without any errors), it can be
configured nicely (by scanning barcodes, of course<A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="#foot23"><SUP>6</SUP></A>) and it identifies itself as a
normal USB keyboard, hence allowing me to use it with FreeBSD (or
Windows).

<P>
I configured the scanner to read the barcode, print it with alphanumeric
characters and add a newline afterwards. This meant I could use
<TT>vim</TT>, the best text editor, and scan every book I encountered.
The EANs would be added to a list, which I would process later on. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Hyppolyta, the Amazon queen</A>
</H1>

<P>
After I knew what had to be done, I could begin implementing a program
that would to the following:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Accept a list of EANs as an input file.
</LI>
<LI>Request further information (Title, Author(s)...) via Amazon's ECS.
</LI>
<LI>Save information about the items in a sensible and practical
format.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The name ``Hyppolyta'' seemed very apt for this program. Forgive me my
bad taste. Besides wondering how anyone could name a program
``Hyppolyta'', you may have noticed that I wrote `items' instead of
`books'. This was a perfectly sane decision: Since amazon.com offers a
lot more products besides books, I wanted my program to be as general as
possible in order to get information about all sorts of products that
can be identified by EANs. This resulted in me catalogueing my audio CDs
and DVDs, too (but this is an entirely different story. Let's focus
here.).

<P>
Hyppolyta is written in Perl<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="#foot28"><SUP>7</SUP></A>. I am by no means a Perl wizard. In fact, it
was my first project that was done in Perl. I am sure that the code
could be implemented much more smoothly, therefore I encourage you to
rewrite it if you consider it too offensive.

<P>
The current version of Hyppolyta is able to generate CSV output. This
simple format should allow you to use your data in almost any program.
Just make sure that the program you are going to use for imports is able
to understand CSV data that contains the newline character in fields!
Every field is escaped by default via <code>"</code><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="#foot29"><SUP>8</SUP></A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
Untar everything. Install <TT>wget</TT> and place it in the path of your
Perl interpreter. Furthermore, install the following Perl modules, if
not already present:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>LWP::UserAgent</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>MIME::Base64</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>XML::XPath</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>Date::Format</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>Text::CSV_XS</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>Getopt::Long</TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
As a last step, open <TT>hyppolyta.pl</TT>, look for the
line:

<P>
<PRE> 
my $req_key = "[YOUR KEY]";
</PRE> 

<P>
Add your AWS access key. If you do not have one, please register with
Amazon (<TT><A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="http://aws.amazon.com">http://aws.amazon.com</A></TT>).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
First steps</A>
</H2>

<P>
The steps of a general session with Hyppolyta could be something like
this:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Go through the shelves/boxes one by one. Scan all books you
encounter. I suggest sorting them before starting to scan them. For
example, I tend to group them in two categories, ``technical
literature'' versus ``fiction'' and scan each category in a separate
text file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>You should now have a list of EANs/ISBNs. Each line does not
contain any whitespaces and ends with a newline character. Start
Hyppolyta from the command-line via:

<P>
<PRE>
./hyppolyta.pl -i &lt;input file&gt; -o &lt;output file&gt;.csv
</PRE> 

<P>
If you do not want Hyppolyta to download images for each item, specifiy
the <code>-n</code> switch, too. Otherwise, all available images are stored in
a subdirectory depending on the search index: If the search index is
<TT>DVD</TT>, images will be stored in the folder <TT>./dvd/</TT>. The
URI of the image is set accordingly, thus allowing you to simply upload
the appropriate folder to your server in order to display all DVDs. By
default, <TT>wget</TT> is used to download the images.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Hyppolyta will now download all information about the items and
store them in a CSV file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Import the file and have fun. As always, this step is left out as
an exercice to the reader. 

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
More complex usages</A>
</H2>

<P>
To understand Hyppolyta's configuration options you have to learn the
basics about the ``Amazon E-Commerce Service'' (ECS). To get data from
Amazon, an <TT>ItemLookup</TT> request is used. This request has several
important parameters, which are preset by default when no other options
are present: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <TT>ReqEnd</TT> which specifies the locale. Set to <TT>de</TT>
by default. You can change this via the <TT>-l</TT> or <TT>-locale</TT>
switch:

<P>
<PRE>
./hyppolyta.pl -i &lt;input file&gt; --locale co.uk
</PRE>

<P>
Valid locales are (among others): <TT>com</TT>, <TT>co.uk</TT>,
<TT>de</TT>. Please note that not all locales share the same database.
It is advisable to change the locale if an insufficient number of items
has been retrieved.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <TT>IDType</TT> that specifies the type of the search
parameters, for example ISBN (default), UPC<A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="#foot65"><SUP>9</SUP></A> or EAN. Actually, more options are possible,
but these are not covered here.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <TT>ItemID</TT>, a list of up to 10 items of the type
specified by <TT>IDType</TT>. These are, in fact, the codes you scanned
earlier. The ID type can be changed using the <TT>-t</TT> or the
<TT>-idtype</TT> switch:

<P>
<PRE>
./hyppolyta.pl -i upc.txt -t UPC
</PRE>

<P>
Not all locales support all ID types. Read the fine manual for reference
purposes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <TT>SearchIndex</TT> that tells Amazon which part of the
catalogue is to be searched. Valid values include: Books, ForeignBooks,
Music, DVD. The default value is ``Books''. However this implies that
<I>only</I> books of the request's locale are queried! That means: If
the locale is set to <TT>de</TT> (by default), books in other languages
will be available <I>only</I> (!) by using the ``ForeignBooks''
search index. Specifying the search index is possible via the
<TT>-s</TT> or <TT>-search-index</TT> switch:

<P>
<PRE>
./hyppolyta.pl -e -i classical_music.txt -s Music
</PRE> 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <TT>ResponseGroup</TT>, which used by Amazon to decide what
information about an items is sent back. For example: The response group
<TT>ItemAttributes</TT> returns a lot of information about each item,
including package dimensions, whereas <TT>EditorialReviews</TT> adds the
``official'' review of the item to the response (if available). More
information is available in the ECS documentation. 

<P>
This parameter should <I>not</I> be changed by the end user. Keep your hands
off it unless you know what you are doing.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If available, as much as 10 items are used in one request. After the
request has been assembled, it is sent to Amazon for processing. The
response will be an XML file which is parsed by the <TT>XML::XPath</TT>
module. This is where the heart of the program lies.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00034000000000000000">
Tweaking Hyppolyta</A>
</H2>

<P>
To keep the program as general as possible, hashes are used everywhere
in the program. If you look at the code, you will find two important
variables: <code>@attributes_general</code> and <code>%attributes_specific</code>. 

<P>
I will now explain to you how to use these wisely.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00034100000000000000">
<TT>@attributes_general</TT></A>
</H3> 

<P>
This is a list of attributes that have to be included in every request.
Each item has two subitems: First, the title/name of the attribute is
specified.  Then, a relative path that tells Hyppolyta where the
attribute can be found in the response<A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="#foot88"><SUP>10</SUP></A>.

<P>
The name of the item is used when the CSV header is written. Although it
is possible to use titles such as <TT>Item1</TT>, <TT>Item2</TT> etc.,
it is not prudent as it makes parsing and understanding a CSV file much
harder. You can change the names to your leisure. 

<P>
The <TT>NodeIterate</TT> value tells Hyppolyta wich nodes are to be used
to iterate over multiple items. In general, this is just the node of the
attribute as described in the ECS documentation. It is also possible to
add new attributes. Just make sure that the path to <TT>NodeIterate</TT>
is correct.

<P>
The value in <TT>NodeValue</TT> tell Hyppolyta where it should look for
the actual value you want to receive. This may be different from the
<TT>NodeIterate</TT> setting.

<P>
Furthermore, specify the flag <code>Output =&gt; 1</code> if you want Hyppolyta
to print these values every time a new item has been retrieved from a
request.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00034110000000000000">
Example:</A>
</H4> Suppose we have a node called `Person'. This node
has a child called `Name'. It it stored by ECS in the following way:

<P>
<PRE>
Person -- Name, Person -- Name, Person -- Name
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, we would set <TT>NodeIterate</TT> to `Person' (actually,
the whole path has to be used. But this is an example, after all) and
<TT>NodeValue</TT> to `Name'.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00034200000000000000">
<TT>@attributes_specific</TT></A>
</H3>

<P>
An associative array for attributes that are only requested if a certain
search index is used. The array's key is the search index (keep in mind
that ECS is indeed case-sensitive), the value is another hash of
attributes that are requested for every item. The syntax is the same as
above (<TT>Name</TT>, <TT>NodeIterate</TT> etc.).

<P>
While this may seem clumsy, it is, in fact, <I>not</I>, as I dare to say:
People who want to organize their music collection need more information
about artists etc., whereas people who want to sort their books are
almost always happy to know about the author and the publisher...

<P>
If you want to add attributes, please read the ECS documentation for
more information.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00035000000000000000">
Use case: My collection</A>
</H2>

<P>
Let's suppose you have your well-ordered list of ISBNs. Before doing
anything else, these should be sorted according to their origin: In
13-digit ISBNs, the 4th digit will specify the origin: 4 is for Germany
(or German-speaking countries), anything else for, well, another
country. In 10-digit ISBNs, the origin is coded in the first number.
Same game.

<P>
Use whatever you want to divide the list in two new lists (one with the
``foreign'' books and one with the local ones): Write a script, do it
manually, use <TT>awk</TT> and <TT>sed</TT> etc.

<P>
At last, do two runs of Hyppolyta:

<P>
<PRE>
./hyppolyta.pl -i books_german.txt -o books_german.csv 
./hyppolyta.pl -i books_foreign.txt -s ForeignBooks -o books_foreign.csv
</PRE>

<P>
The .csv files now contain data about your books. Furthermore, images
for every item available should have been downloaded.
